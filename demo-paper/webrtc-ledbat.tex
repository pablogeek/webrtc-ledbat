\begin{abstract}
  The WebRTC framework enables direct browser-to-browser communication for VoIP,
  video-conferencing but also generic javascript-based peer-to-peer (P2P) applications. In
  this
  paper, we address a major deficiency of the framework, that is the abscence of a
  background transfer protocol. In doing so, we enable the development of unintrusive
  data-intensive P2P applications, such as file-sharing and content delivery, on top of
  WebRTC.
  % For achieving our goal, we provide an implementation of Lower Extra Delay Background
  % Transfer (LEDBAT) that transparently interacts with the already existing components of
  %the WebRTC stack. 
This work constitutes the first step in the
  process of studying and improving WebRTC's network stack in the context of a real
  use-case, that is a commercial distributed content delivery application.

\mysec{Introduction}
% WebRTC general 
Recently, WebRTC has been steadily gaining popularity, fueled by large scale deployment in
most of the browsers on the market. The WebRTC standard mandates the multimedia and
peer-to-peer connectivity stacks for real-time services, once provided by external
plugins, to be built directly into the browser. As a consequence, the features of those
stacks, such as video acquisition/encoding, encryption and NAT traversal, are made
available to developers through HTML5 APIs. WebRTC was mainly designed as a framework to
facilitate video and audio conferencing but it does include support for building other
types of peer-to-peer applications, such as CDN accellerators~\cite{peerCDN} and video
streaming platforms~\cite{nurminen2013p2p}.


% Why LEDBAT is important
Although WebRTC currently provides many features, it lacks support for background
transfers. That is an essential requirement for P2P data-intensive applications, e.g.
BitTorrent~\cite{pouwelse2005bittorrent} and streaming platforms ~\cite{smoothcache}, which utilize
this feature to avoid disrupting other traffic in the network. Support for background
transfers is provided in dedicated P2P transport library by the adoption of a delay-based
congestion control protocol, such as LEDBAT~\cite{ledbat-rfc}. LEDBAT has two main
features: first, it completely yields to TCP, and second, it introduces a low and constant
amount of delay on a link. The former feature allows LEDBAT to back off to all TCP-based
traffic and therefore do not interfere in terms of bandwidth consumption with, for
instance, HTTP web browsing traffic and large file transfers through FTP. The latter
feature instead prevents large LEDBAT transfers to disrupt delay- and jitter-sensitive
applications, such as voice over ip and gaming. This is in direct contrast to the behavior
of TCP, which introduces an arbitrary high delay on a link with a significant amount of
jitter.

% What we did 
In this paper, we present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first implementation
of a background transfer protocol for the WebRTC framework. By providing support for
LEDBAT, we enable the development of data-intensive P2P applications on top of
WebRTC. In our specific case however, the interest in LEDBAT is motivated by the the needs
of a commercial peer-assisted video distribution application called Hive
Streaming~\cite{hive}. Hive utilizes low priority traffic to prefetch data from other
peers ahead of the playback deadline without disrupting other traffic in the network.

Besides including LEDBAT in WebRTC, our greater goal is to provide a comprehensive study
of the functionality and performance of WebRTC's transport protocols. This, in order to
understand and address possible shortcomings that would prevent wide adoption of this
technology. For that, as the next step, we intend to provide a detailed analysis of the
behavior of WebRTC's transport protocols in a real use-case, that is video streaming.

In order to promote adoption of our augmented version of WebRTC, which contains background
transfer support and other improvements to the WebRTC stack, we make our code available
as open-source at~\cite{webrtc-utp}.

% Given these initial results, we intend to continue to validate the behavior of our
% implementation of LEDBAT in WebRTC. Most importantly however, we will be concentrating our
% efforts in studying the efficiency of both SCTP and LEDBAT in the context of P2P
% data-intensive browser applications, invrstigating potential bottlenecks and proposing
% solutions to the current WebRTC stack.

\mysec{LEDBAT in WebRTC}


In WebRTC, transfer of arbitrary data over P2P channels is a feature provided by the
DataChannel abstraction.

% - how SCTP works
%The main reason why SCTP was chosen as application level transport protocol for the DataChannel is that it natively support some interesting features such as configurable in-order delivery, configurable reliability and a channel priority level defined by the application. Moreover it provides flow control and congestion control, while security is ensured by tunnelling all the traffic through a secure DTLS session, which itself run on top of UDP.

The DataChannel API make currently use of the Stream Control Transfer protocol
(SCTP)~\cite{sctp-rfc} protocol in order to manage generic data transfers. SCTP is a
message-oriented protocol that provides a variety of options on data transfer to
accomodate the needs of different types of applications, such in- or out-order delivery
and configurable reliability. 
% When setting up a DataChannel,
% WebRTC applications may choose in- or out-of-order delivery and reliable or unreliable
% delivery. 
From the confestion control point of view, SCTP is mainly the same as TCP~\cite{htcp},
however it is designed to deliver better throughput in networks with high delay but large
amount of bandwidth. Therefore, in general, SCTP is expected to equally share the
bandwidth avaialble with other TCP and SCTP transfers and, as TCP, to introduce arbitrary
delay on a link.

The current version of WebRTC's DataChannel incorporates a user-level SCTP
implementation~\footnote{http://sctp.fh-muenster.de/sctp-user-land-stack.html} written in
\textit{C} and built on top of UDP. SCTP interfaces with a security layer, Datagram
Transport Layer Security (DTLS), which adds encryption and integrity to all traffic sent
through a DataChannel session. All data sent through that session is carried over
connections that have been established using the NAT Traversal protocol.


% - what we changed
%In order to implement LEDBAT support in WebRTC, we opted to modify and integrate the
%\textit{uTP} library \cite{utp-repo} in the WebRTC protocol stack as runtime alternative
%to SCTP. uTP is the reference open-source implementation of LEDBAT and is provided by
%BitTorrent. Similarly to SCTP, uTP provides reliability, in-order delivery and is layered
%over UDP. Given the similarities between the protocols, we were able to integrate uTP with
%the existing WebRTC stack by implementing a translation layer in-between the layers. The
%translation layer transaltes API requests from the DataChannel layer for the uTP
%layer. Besides that, we modified the DataChannel API to be able to choose between SCTP and
%uTP as transport protocol when setting up a data channel. Finally, we were able to channel
%all data processed by the uTP implementation into the DTLS processing. The resulting
%structure of the WebRTC stack is shown in Figure \ref{fig:architecture}.

In order to implement LEDBAT support in WebRTC, we opted to integrate the \textit{uTP} library 
\cite{utp-repo} in the WebRTC protocol stack as runtime alternative to SCTP. uTP is the reference
open-source implementation of LEDBAT and is provided by BitTorrent. Similarly to SCTP, uTP 
provides reliability, in-order delivery and is layered over UDP.

Given the similarities between the protocols, we were able to encapsulate uTP over DTLS over ICE/UDP and integrate it within the existing WebRTC stack by extending the latter with a new data channel type, the LedbatDataMediaChannel. This is managed directly by the LedbatDataEngine, which takes care of registering the callbacks on the uTP sockets and handling the Channel Control Messages. Moreover, since DataChannel and SCTP directly handle application messages rather then data streams, the LedbatDataEngine also takes care of incoming message reconstruction.

\mysec{Preliminary results}


% - setup
We conducted a preliminary evaluation of our solution in a controlled network environment
consisting of two host machines, a sender and a receiver, running Ubuntu Linux with kernel
3.11.0-12 connected through a 1 Mbps link with 100 ms base delay and 60KB of queue
buffer to simulate a typical WAN gateway scenario.

%In order to test our implementation, we developed a test application in \textit{C} that
%generates traffic using the WebRTC Native DataChannel API to emulate the traffic
%of a data-intensive browser application. Our test application can be configured
%to initialize either a STCP DataChannel, or a LEDBAT DataChannel.
%
%Both hosts run our test application and a separate TCP traffic generator to obtain traffic
%competing on the same network resources. TCP file transfer uses TCP Cubic, the default
%Linux congestion control. Finally, a third host acts as a server to handle the WebRTC
%session signalling between the sender and the receiver.

Both hosts run a Chromium browser built with the modified WebRTC module, which can be configured to use either a STCP DataChannel, or a LEDBAT DataChannel. We then use an HTML5 application to generate DataChannel transfers from the sender to the receiver host, and a separate TCP traffic generator to obtain traffic competing on the same network resources.

% - metrics
As metrics, we utilize the throughput of the DataChannel LEDBAT transfers when competing
against TCP traffic, and the Round Trip Time (RTT) measured on the link. With these two
metrics, we verify that LEDBAT transfers indeed yield to TCP and, at the same time, we
evaluate the relative increase on the one-way delay, which directly affects latency and,
therefore, web browsing responsiveness.

% - evaluation
Figure \ref{fig:2ledbat_tcp} shows the throughput evolution of two DataChannel LEDBAT
streams and a single TCP stream, starting at 60 seconds from each other. The corresponding
Round Trip Time is also shown above. The two LEDBAT flows, as expected, utilize all
available bandwidth, until they quickly and completely release the bottleneck in favour of
the higher priority TCP flow. The increase in the RTT due to the presence of LEDBAT flows
is limited to 100 millisecond, which is the default target delay configuration in
uTP. Note that the number of LEDBAT streams doesn't affect the amount of extra delay
introduced.

%During the initial two minutes of the experiment, the LEDBAT streams correctly use all the available network resources while maintaining the introduced extra delay to a maximum of 100 millisecond, correspondent to the default target delay configured in uTP. At second 120 the two streams quickly release resources in favour of the higher priority TCP flow until it terminates. 

For direct comparison and validation that the normal behavior of SCTP was not affected,
Figure \ref{fig:2sctp_tcp} shows the same experiment performed configuring our test
application to use DataChannel SCTP streams. Besides fairly sharing the link with the TCP
transfer as expected, each of the SCTP streams introduce a large amount of extra-delay on
the link as TCP does.
